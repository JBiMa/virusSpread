# Virus Spread Simulator

**Overview**

Virus Spread Simulator is a Java-based application designed to simulate the spread of a virus in a population. This application provides a visual representation of how individuals in a population move and interact, and how these interactions can lead to the spread of a virus. It includes features such as different health states for individuals (healthy, no symptoms, symptoms, immune) and dynamic movement of individuals within a simulated environment.

**Features**

- **Simulation of Virus Spread:** Visualize how a virus can spread through a population over time.
- **Health States:** Individuals can be in different health states: healthy, showing no symptoms, showing symptoms, or immune.
- **Dynamic Movement:** Individuals move within the simulation area, with their movement patterns affecting the spread of the virus.
- **Boundary Collision:** Individuals change direction upon hitting the boundaries of the simulation area.
- **State Persistence:** Ability to save and load the state of the simulation for future analysis.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters like the number of individuals, infection radius, and initial immunity.

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/virus-spread-simulator.git
   cd virus-spread-simulator
   ```


2. **Build the Application:**

   Requires Java JDK 11 or higher and Maven. Run the following command to build the application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   After building, run the application using:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/virus-spread-simulator-1.0.jar
   ```

**Usage**

1. **Start the Simulation:**
   Use the 'Start' button in the application to start the simulation.

2. **Adjust Parameters:**
   Adjust parameters like the number of individuals and initial immunity using the provided sliders and input fields.

3. **Save/Load Simulation State:**
   Save the current state of the simulation and load it later for further analysis.

4. **View Simulation:**
   Observe how the virus spreads among the population within the simulation area.
